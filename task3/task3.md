# Task 3: Evaluate with ROUGE

### Objective:
In this section, your task is to evaluate the outputs of your Social GPT model using the ROUGE metric and analyze the model's performance. Additionally, you will compare two decoding strategies(greedy decoding and beam search) and evaluate each method's effectiveness.

### Subtasks:
1. **Implement the calculate_rouge function:**
    - This function should evaluate your model's predictions against the reference text using the ROUGE metric. Ensure that it handles outputs from different decoding methods (greedy vs. beam search) and computes ROUGE scores for each.
2. **Summary and Analysis (within 5 sentences):**
    - Provide a detailed analysis of your model's performance using the ROUGE scores.
    - Evaluate and compare the performance of both the greedy decoded output and beam search decoded output against the reference text. Discuss which decoding strategy yields better results based on the ROUGE scores and why you think that is the case.


### Instruction:
1. In the '**Evaluate with ROUGE**' section, review the comments provided for each part and complete the code where `# TODO: Implement Here` is indicated.
2. Check if the function you implemented works properly by running the cells in âœ… **Self-Check** section.
3. In the '**Summary and Analysis**' section, write your discussion within 5 sentences.
