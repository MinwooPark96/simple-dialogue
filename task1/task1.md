# Task 1: Train GPT-2 with the DailyDialog Dataset

### Objective:
Your objective is to train a GPT-2 model using the DailyDialog dataset. This involves transforming the dataset into a format suitable for training an autoregressive language model. 
 

### Subtasks:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Implement the `preprocess_dataset` function to transform the raw dialog data into a format that can be used by the model. Ensure the data is structured appropriately for training an autoregressive language model.

2. **Encoding**:
   - Implement the `encode` function to convert the transformed dataset into a format suitable for input into the model. This step is critical for ensuring the data is correctly interpreted by the GPT-2 model.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Implement the `calculate_loss` function to define how the loss is calculated during training. The correct implementation of this function is crucial for effective model training, as it guides the optimization process.


### Instruction:
1. Carefully follow the comments and instructions provided within each function in the code. These instructions and comments are
designed to help you fulfill the specific requirements for each part of the task. Ensure you implement the `TODO` parts in each function.
2. Check if the function you implemented works properly by running the cells in âœ… **Self-Check** section.
